# dev-help
I find I make references and arguments several times over the course of my career and thought I should write them down so that I can refer to them later on. The idea is to be not to long in my descriptions. Possibly some text and summarizing bullets.

## TODO

* ticket structure
* arguments to use when
  * Why do I need structure in the backlog?
    * What should that structure look like?
  * Why and what information do I need on my backlog items?
  * Why is information on tickets not enough? (Shared understanding)
  * What could be bad about adding more resources? What could be good?
  * What's the problem with moving resources around?
  * Why is it important to have a prioritized backlog and saying "no" when someone comes screaming.
  * Why should I not use the backlog as a list with _everything_

* What are the symptoms of
  * lack of shared understanding
